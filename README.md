# Fork information
Replaces files.multimc.org with whatever [PolyMC meta](https://github.com/PolyMC/meta-polymc) uses because some launchers are blocked from accessing files.multimc.org.

# ARMhf/ARM64 Linux only - meta-multimc
Auto Updating MultiMC/Launcher Minecraft package metadata for ARM64 and ARMhf Linux. Use the `master-clean` branch for ARM64 and `master-clean-arm32` for ARMhf. Warning: No support will be given by Mojang or MultiMC for using this meta repo, all issues should be created via this repo.

[L4T-Megascript](https://github.com/cobalt2727/L4T-Megascript) and [pi-apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps) use this meta repo for ARMhf/ARM64 Linux support in MultiMC/Launcher, if running a debian based system, it is preferable to install via one of these two projects.

The meta repo automatically updates with a [github actions workflow](https://github.com/theofficialgman/meta-multimc/blob/update_auto/.github/workflows/update_repo.yml). This update runs hourly (if github can manage to schedule it). 

## This repo includes:
- LWJGL 2.9.4-nightly-20150209 (for minecraft 1.12 and older)<br>
- jinput 2.0.7 (it appears that jinput 2.0.5 from mojang is actually closer to 2.0.7) a library used for game controllers on minecraft 1.12.2 and older, tested with this mod: https://github.com/ljsimin/MinecraftJoypadSplitscreenMod<br>
- backported versions of 3.1.6, 3.2.1, and 3.2.2 for armhf/arm64 compatibility, and a spoofed 3.1.2 (for prerelease 1.13 minecraft)<br>
- official lwjgl 3.3.1 armhf/arm64 linux builds are also included for use with Minecraft 22w16a (1.19 prerelease) and newer<br>

The only library that does not have a native arm64/armhf version is the narrator library created by Mojang. This just means the in-game narrator is unavailable. If you know a way to get the source for this library and build it for armhf/arm64 linux, create an issue here.

All currently released versions of minecraft function on armhf (`master-clean-arm32` branch) and arm64 (`master-clean` branch) linux.

## To use if building the current MultiMC/Launcher source, specify the below applicable cmake variable:<br>
arm64 linux:
```
-DLauncher_META_URL:STRING="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theofficialgman/meta-multimc/master-clean/index.json" 
```
arm32 linux:
```
-DLauncher_META_URL:STRING="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theofficialgman/meta-multimc/master-clean-arm32/index.json"
```
## Binaries:

The lwjgl (and jinput) binaries are hosted here (both lwjgl2 and lwjgl3 with each version having its own branch):<br>
